This internship combined structured workshops with real world project implementation, where I worked on impactful AI-powered solutions across the Legal & Internal Audit and HR departments. I had the opportunity to work on two projects: AI Contract handling tool - developed individually, this tool automates and streamlines the review of long, complex contracts. Leveraging text extraction, chunking, embeddings & vectorstore, and LLM, it enables semantic search, retrieval, and key information extraction, making contract analysis faster, smarter, and more reliable. Candidate Pool Management Assistant (CPMA) - developed collaboratively with my teammates Nour Salem, Hala Hagag, Menna Elgamal, and Laila Amgad El Zawawy, this tool enhances recruitment by matching candidates to job descriptions more effectively. By combining optical character recognition (OCR), LLM-based summarization, vector embedding, ranking and scoring, and LLM-based evaluations, the system efficiently identifies top candidates and supports HR decision-making."
